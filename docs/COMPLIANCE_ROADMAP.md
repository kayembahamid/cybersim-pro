# CyberSim Pro Compliance Roadmap

This roadmap gives CISOs, Legal, and Risk teams a transparent view into how CyberSim Pro attains enterprise governance expectations. It outlines attestation goals, data residency commitments, and the underpinning internal controls with named deliverables, owners, and target dates. The timeline is intentionally aggressive—each milestone is paired with status signals and gating dependencies so stakeholders can track slippage early.

---

## 1. Attestation Milestones

| Program | Objective | Target Date | Owner | Status | Key Artifacts |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------|--------|---------------|
| SOC 2 Type I | Establish baseline trust services controls, complete readiness assessment, and deliver auditor review. | 2025-02-28 | Compliance Lead | ⚙️ In Progress | Control matrix, evidence binder, gap remediation log |
| SOC 2 Type II | Operate controls for 6 months, collect evidence, and obtain final report. | 2025-09-30 | Compliance Lead | ⏳ Planned | Continuous monitoring dashboards, operation logs |
| ISO/IEC 27001 | Implement ISMS, run internal audit, pass stage 1 & 2 certification audits. | 2025-11-30 | CISO | ⏳ Planned | Statement of Applicability, risk register, ISMS manual |
| HIPAA Mapping | Map existing controls to HIPAA Security Rule, document gaps for covered entities. | 2025-03-31 | Security Engineering | ⏳ Planned | HIPAA control crosswalk, risk assessment |

### Immediate Actions
- Finalize SOC 2 readiness gap analysis (owners assigned for each gap, due 2024-12-15).
- Publish public-facing compliance landing page summarizing roadmap, evidence portal access policy, and audit contact (target 2024-12-22).
- Stand up compliance evidence locker (AWS GovCloud S3 Object Lock) with lifecycle policies (target 2025-01-05).

## 2. Data Residency & Tenancy Options

| Offering | Description | Availability | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| US Multi-tenant | Primary production in AWS us-east-1/us-west-2 with S3 Object Lock for audit logs. | ✅ Available | Default deployment. SOC 2 Type I coverage in 2025.
| EU Multi-tenant | Mirrored deployment in AWS eu-central-1 with EU support engineers. | 🚧 ETA 2025-Q2 | Processor agreements and DPA templates drafted.
| Dedicated Tenant (US/EU) | Customer-dedicated VPC, KMS keys, audit storage. | 🚧 ETA 2025-Q3 | Requires minimum 12-month commitment.
| On-prem Appliance | Docker/Kubernetes package with offline evidence export. | 🧪 Research | Architecture review scheduled 2025-Q3.

**Planned Enhancements**
- Residency selector surfaced in provisioning workflow (API + admin UI) – design due 2025-01-10.
- Audit seal replication to customer-managed storage (S3/Azure Blob with immutability) – prototype 2025-02-15.

## 3. Internal Control Framework

| Control Domain | Control ID | Description | Evidence Source | Owner |
|----------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Change Management | CM-01 | All production changes require peer review and automated test suite. | GitHub PR templates, CI logs | Engineering
| Change Management | CM-02 | Emergency changes recorded with retrospective review within 48 hours. | PagerDuty postmortems | Engineering Ops
| Vulnerability Management | VM-01 | Weekly dependency scanning with `npm audit` + Snyk, tracked in backlog. | Security tooling dashboards | Security Eng
| Vulnerability Management | VM-02 | Quarterly penetration test & threat modeling updates. | Vendor reports, threat model docs | Security Eng
| Backup & Recovery | BR-01 | Hourly database snapshots + daily encrypted offsite copies. | Backup logs, restore drill runbooks | Platform Ops
| Backup & Recovery | BR-02 | Semi-annual disaster recovery exercises with RTO/RPO metrics. | DR reports, exec summaries | Platform Ops
| Access Management | AM-01 | SSO mandatory for staff, MFA enforced, JIT access for production. | IdP audit logs, access reviews | IT Security
| Audit & Logging | AU-01 | Immutable audit log with chain-of-custody seals (`npm run audit:seal`). | Seal bundles, validation reports | Platform Ops

> **Note:** Control descriptions are mapped to SOC 2, ISO 27001 Annex A, and NIST CSF in `docs/control-mapping.json`.

---

## 4. Communication Plan

- **Monthly Compliance Report**: email + Confluence update summarizing milestones, blockers, evidence collected.
- **Quarterly Executive Briefing**: align CISO, GC, CIO on roadmap progress, budget needs, and risk acceptance decisions.
- **Customer Transparency**: public roadmap updates each quarter; optional NDA briefing for strategic customers.

### Escalation Paths
- **Compliance Lead → CISO** for missed milestones >14 days.
- **Security Engineering → CTO** for critical vulnerabilities uncovered during readiness.
- **Customer Success → Legal** for custom DPA or audit requests.

---

## 5. Dependencies & Tooling

- **Evidence Locker**: S3 bucket with Object Lock (governance mode), integrated with audit seal exports.
- **Control Tracking**: Jira project `GOV-CTRL` for tasks, linked to SOC 2 gap analysis.
- **Monitoring**: Automated jobs to regenerate `generate_validation_report` digest weekly, alert on anomalies.
- **Seal Automation**: Weekly scheduled run of `npm run audit:seal` via CI cron pushing bundles to the evidence locker with 12-month retention.
- **Document Management**: Notion/Confluence space with restricted access for auditors.

---

## 6. Next Steps

1. Approve roadmap internally (CISO & Legal) and publish sanitized version externally.
2. Implement telemetry to capture control evidence (see forthcoming `tooling/complianceTracker.ts`).
3. Begin SCIM/SSO integration planning in parallel—output will feed Access Management control objectives.
