# Community Sharing Program

CyberSim Pro encourages a curated sharing model so trusted operators can exchange sanitized scenarios, detection packs, and after-action insights without leaking sensitive tradecraft.

## Contribution Flow
1. **Fork & Branch** – contributors fork the repository (or internal mirror) and branch from `community/main`.
2. **Sanitize** – remove production indicators, replace payloads with `[SIMULATED_PAYLOAD]`, and ensure logs contain synthetic hostnames.
3. **Annotate** – include metadata (`sector`, `adversary_profile`, relevant `focus_cves`) and reference detection artefacts generated by CyberSim.
4. **Submit PR** – target the community branch; automated checks verify schema compliance, guardrails, and audit logging coverage.
5. **Review Board** – a purple-team steward reviews submissions for policy alignment before merging.

## Repository Layout
```
community/
  scenarios/             # JSON exports from create_scenario
  detections/            # Sigma/KQL/Splunk bundles
  reports/               # Executive & technical outputs from generate_report
  lessons-learned/       # Markdown retrospectives for each exercise
  metadata.json          # Contributor roster, licensing, acceptable-use acknowledgements
```

## Acceptable Use
- All material **must** reference authorised lab environments.
- No live payloads, exploit code, or customer data.
- Contributors self-attest to acceptable-use policy in `docs/POLICY_AND_ETHICS.md`.
- Audit logs (`logs/audit.log`) from dry runs can be attached for verification.

## Distribution Options
- **Public GitHub** – recommended for open, sanitised playbooks.
- **Private GitHub Enterprise** – map to the same structure but restrict membership to vetted teams.
- **Artifact Registry** – package detection artefacts as OCI images (e.g., `hamcodes/cybersim-packs`) for automated deployment.

## Automation Hooks
- Continuous integration validates YAML/JSON schema, ensures `[SIMULATED_PAYLOAD]` markers, and runs `npm run build` to confirm compatibility.
- Optional webhook posts notify Slack/Teams channels when new community content is available.
- The HTTP bridge (`/tool/generate_report`) can ingest community bundles via automation for production readiness checks.

By nurturing a vetted community stream, CyberSim Pro evolves in lockstep with emerging TTPs while keeping resilience playbooks transparent and auditable.
