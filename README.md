## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone or create the project directory:**
```bash
mkdir cybersim-pro-mcp
cd cybersim-pro-mcp
```

2. **Create the source directory structure:**
```bash
mkdir -p src/{scenarios,simulators,managers,analyzers}
```

3. **Copy all source files into their respective directories:**
   - `index.ts` ‚Üí `src/`
   - `scenarioManager.ts` ‚Üí `src/scenarios/`
   - `networkSimulator.ts` ‚Üí `src/simulators/`
   - `threatSimulator.ts` ‚Üí `src/simulators/`
   - `incidentResponseManager.ts` ‚Üí `src/managers/`
   - `forensicsAnalyzer.ts` ‚Üí `src/analyzers/`

4. **Initialize and install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

5. **Build the project:**
```bash
npm run build
```

## üê≥ Docker

Build and run the MCP server inside Docker (stdio-based):

1) Build image

```bash
docker build -t cybersim-pro-mcp ./cybersim-pro-mcp
```

2) Run (stdio)

```bash
docker run --rm -i cybersim-pro-mcp
```

To use Docker with the Cline VS Code extension, configure the server as:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cybersim-pro": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "cybersim-pro-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Notes
- The server communicates over stdio; no ports are exposed.
- Rebuild the image after changes: `docker build -t cybersim-pro-mcp ./cybersim-pro-mcp`.

### Unified Launcher (Node or Docker)

Use a single wrapper that runs Node by default, or Docker when `CYBERSIM_RUNTIME=docker`:

Wrapper script: `cybersim-pro-mcp/scripts/run-cybersim.sh`

Examples:

```bash
# Local build (Node)
CYBERSIM_RUNTIME=node cybersim-pro-mcp/scripts/run-cybersim.sh

# Docker image (ensure image is built)
CYBERSIM_RUNTIME=docker cybersim-pro-mcp/scripts/run-cybersim.sh
```

Configure Cline (VS Code) to use the unified launcher:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cybersim-pro-auto": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/cybersim-pro-mcp/scripts/run-cybersim.sh",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Desktop can also point to the same script; set `CYBERSIM_RUNTIME` in your shell or via a small wrapper if desired.

### HTTP Bridge (for GPT Actions and non‚ÄëMCP clients)

Run a simple HTTP server that mirrors the MCP tools:

```bash
cd cybersim-pro-mcp
npm run serve:http
# Default port: 8787 (override with PORT=xxxx)
```

Example calls:

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8787/health

curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8787/tool/create_scenario \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type":"ransomware","difficulty":"advanced","environment":"corporate"}'
```

OpenAPI spec: `cybersim-pro-mcp/http-openapi.yaml` (serve this file when configuring GPT Actions).

#### Make it public quickly (tunnels)

You can expose the local HTTP bridge with a tunnel service:

```bash
# Example using Cloudflare Tunnel (warp/v2) or ngrok
# ngrok (requires account):
ngrok http 8787

# cloudflared (if you have a domain):
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8787
```

For production, run in Docker on a server/VPS and expose the port:

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t cybersim-pro-mcp ./cybersim-pro-mcp

# Run HTTP bridge publicly on port 8787
docker run -d --name cybersim-pro-http \
  -e CYBERSIM_MODE=http \
  -e CYBERSIM_API_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN \
  -p 8787:8787 \
  cybersim-pro-mcp

# Verify
curl -sS http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8787/health

curl -sS -X POST http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8787/tool/create_scenario \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type":"ransomware","difficulty":"advanced"}'

Security options
- API key: set `CYBERSIM_API_KEY` and send `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on requests (required for /tool/* when set).
- IP allowlist (optional): set `CYBERSIM_IP_ALLOW` with comma-separated IPs (e.g., `127.0.0.1,::1,203.0.113.10,local`). Requests must come from allowed IPs.

## üì¶ Publish to Docker Hub and list in MCP Toolkit

1) Create a Docker Hub repository named `cybersim-pro-mcp` under your account.

2) Set GitHub secrets in your repository:
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
   - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` (Docker Hub access token)

3) Tag a release in Git (`v1.0.0`, etc.). The workflow builds multi-arch images and pushes:
   - `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`

4) Verify on Docker Hub: `hamcodes/cybersim-pro-mcp` has tags `latest`, `vX.Y.Z`.

5) Improve discoverability: Dockerfile includes OCI labels (title, description, source, license).

6) Submit to MCP Toolkit Catalog:
   - Click ‚ÄúContribute‚Äù in the MCP Toolkit UI or open the catalog repo and add an entry.
   - Use `cybersim-pro-mcp/mcp-catalog.json` as a template; update `image`, `repository`, `homepage`, and `maintainers`.
   - Provide an icon (SVG/PNG) if requested by the catalog and link it.

Suggested Docker run snippet for catalog card (stdio):

```
docker run --rm -i hamcodes/cybersim-pro-mcp:latest
```

Suggested Docker run snippet for catalog card (HTTP):

```
docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 -e CYBERSIM_MODE=http hamcodes/cybersim-pro-mcp:latest
```
```

## üìù Configuration

### Claude Desktop Integration

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cybersim-pro": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/cybersim-pro-mcp/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Desktop via Docker

Build the image first:

```bash
docker build -t cybersim-pro-mcp ./cybersim-pro-mcp
```

Then use this Claude Desktop config to run the server in Docker:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cybersim-pro-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "cybersim-pro-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Desktop (macOS) ‚Äî Quick Launch Scripts

You can point Claude directly to helper scripts for Node or Docker:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cybersim-pro-node": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/cybersim-pro-mcp/scripts/run-cybersim-node.sh",
      "args": []
    },
    "cybersim-pro-docker": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/cybersim-pro-mcp/scripts/run-cybersim-docker.sh",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

Notes
- The Node script expects a built server at `build/index.js`.
- The Docker script expects a built image named `cybersim-pro-mcp` (see Docker section).

### Cline VSCode Extension Integration

Add to your Cline MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cybersim-pro": {

1. Progress to multi-phase attacks (ransomware, APT)
2. Use "intermediate" difficulty
3. Practice incident investigation techniques
4. Analyze network traffic patterns

3. Conduct deep forensic analysis
4. Generate comprehensive security reports

## üîí Security Features

### MITRE ATT&CK Integration
All scenarios and simulations are mapped to MITRE ATT&CK framework, providing:
- Tactic and technique identification
- TTP (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) documentation
- Industry-standard threat categorization

### Realistic Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
Generated IOCs include:
- File hashes (SHA-256)
- IP addresses and domains
- Registry keys and file paths
- Network signatures

### Chain of Custody
Digital forensics maintains proper evidence handling:
- Cryptographic hash verification
- Timestamped custody records
- Handler documentation
- Evidence preservation

## ü§ñ Working with AI Guardrails

- Lead each session with explicit defensive context (authorized lab, training goal) so MCP clients treat the simulation as a safety exercise.
- Phrase red-team actions as simulated steps that support detection practice instead of real exploitation instructions.
- Include safety flags in tool prompts or scenario templates (for example, `training=true`, `environment="lab"`) to help downstream assistants interpret intent.
- Sanitize payload-like output by returning placeholders or high-level descriptions while preserving investigative details to reduce guardrail triggers.
- Provide operators with acceptable-use guidance and keep conversations focused on detection, mitigation, and lessons learned to align with platform policies.
